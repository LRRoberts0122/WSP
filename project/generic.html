				<h3>Who am I??</h3>
				<p>I'm an artist. Whether it be traditional, digital, or professional, I love every pixel and drop of paint because it creates something unique about what I do. My name is Lindsay Roberts. I was born in Leesburg, FL, and was raised in the general vicinity for my entire life. That's a long time in the sunshine state, which in fact, is more cloudy than sunny.</p>
				<p>Since I was a little kid, I've always had a thing for art. Call it talent or a calling, but it's been in my life since I can remember. I even won a regional Fine Arts contest when I was 13.</p>
				<p>In January of 2012  I began to pursue my dream of Web Design & Development at Full Sail University. Since then, I've earned several Course Director's awards for my outstanding work.</p>
				<p>Now I'd like to do your website and give you a fresh, new look on the web.</p>

				<h3>Why choose me?</h3>
				<p>One thing you'll get from me that isn't commonly thought about is a focus on User Experience design. I design to create the most pleasant experience possible to keep your clients coming back for more.</p>
				<p>My design experience is versatile. I can complete any project to fit your needs. Bold, minimal, or stylized, I can do it all.</p>
				<p>More than anything, I have passion. I absolutely love everything web. I will design your website with you and the user in mind so that it benefits everyone.</p>
