		<p>Of the three websites chosen, each is aesthetically pleasing with its own unique style. A good first impression conveys that they know their industry. Specifically, one thing that stands out above the rest is <a href="http://www.mxlbs.de">mxlbs.de</a>. The developer gives the website an identity by featuring a vector icon of himself. Instead, by providing visitors with a picture, they can now establish a sense of trust.</p>
		
		<p>While there are some things that can be admired about the sites listed, each are not without their flaws. <a href="http://www.mxlbs.de">Mxlbs.de</a> forces the user to launch a mail application in order to send messages. By using a contact form, a visitor can send a message quickly and easily right from the website while avoiding the inconvenience of mail applications. Once the message is sent, the visitor can be redirected to more content.</p>
		
		<p>A widget on the homepage of <a href="http://www.opace.co.uk">opace.co.uk</a> has great information organized into tabs. However, each tab takes three to four section to navigate through due to slow transition times. When using CSS3 transitions, they need to be within the parameters for a good UI experience. A single transition should take no more than a second.</p>
		
		<p>Two of the sites listed above did not validate as HTML. Markup should be semantic and in compliance with W3C standards for a variety of reasons. By focusing on these key attributes, we can successfully create a unique and efficient design that will persuade users to stay at the site.</p>
		
		<p>Differentiating from the competition is essential. A more unique, appealing call-to-action that successfully sells the service will be required, as well as easily visible subheadings to promote scanning, and an interesting background. The accumulated, unused assets from <a href="webdevreview.blogspot.com">webdevreview.blogspot.com</a> can provide "Freebies" incentives that will keep visitors coming back.</p>

		<h2>Use Case</h2>
		<p>Patsy Wilkson is 34-years-old and lives in Orlando, FL. She has obtained an Associate of Science degree and works for a local company as a sales representative for an annual salary of $36k. She enjoys watching movies during her free time, as well as maintaining her blog. Patsy keeps up with her blog, AnnualDVD.com while on her 2011 desktop computer. Her operating system is Windows 7, and because she's not too internet savvy, she's using Internet Explorer 8 with 10Mbps of bandwidth.</p>
		<p>Recently, Patsy realized she needs a new, redesigned website. She has had AnnualDVDcom for several years now, where she writes and blogs about the best DVD releases of the year. She finds artofliz.com through Google by searching "Website Redesign in Orlando, FL". She clicks on the first few links, however finds that they are much too expensive for her needs. Upon visiting artofliz.com, the featured section's call-to-action catches her eye. Already, it is displaying a website similar to what she wants for her blog. After reading the information included in the CTA, she has decided that she has time to fill out the form for a free quote. Once she sends the request, a message immediately appears that her email has been sent successfully and a link provides her with more content to explore. She makes her way over to the portfolio section, and begins looking through the various types of work. After a couple of minutes, she closes out of the browser so she can watch a movie.</p>
